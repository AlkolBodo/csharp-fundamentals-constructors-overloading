        //TODO: 3. subtract, which accepts two floats and returns a float (first float minus second float)      

        //TODO: 4. subtract, which accepts a String and a char and returns a string with all instances of the provided char removed        

        //TODO: 5. multiply, which accepts two ints and returns an int (first int multiplied by second int)

        //TODO: 6. multiply, which accepts a string and an int, and returns a string containing the provided string as many times as the provided int separated by a comma. E.g. multiply("Hello", 3) -> "Hello,Hello,Hello"
      
        //TODO: 7. multiply, which accepts an array of Strings that each contain a number, and an int. The method should return an array of ints that contain the value of multiplying each String number by the provided int E.g. multiply(["2", "7", "3"], 3) -> [6, 21, 9]
